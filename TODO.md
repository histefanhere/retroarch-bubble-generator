- change "game" to "rom" in code

- SPECIFICALLY SAY that it should only be used with ROMS you own

- custom `vpk` output path?

# COMPLETED:
- make all paths configurable in settings.yaml (and provide sane defaults)
- example settings.yaml file
- section off the code into discrete parts
- Provide basic startup.png and bg.png _somewhere_

# TRASHED:
- Delete the core.txt and rom.txt files _=>_ all generation content is preserved in ./content/
